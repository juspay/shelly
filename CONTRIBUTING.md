## Shelly Architecture Overview

Shelly uses a **dual CLI architecture** with three main feature areas:

### üîç **Error Analysis** (`src/main.js`)
- **Purpose**: Analyzes failed shell commands and provides AI-powered suggestions
- **Key Services**: `analysisService.js`, `historyService.js`, `shellService.js`
- **Shell Support**: bash, zsh, tcsh compatibility
- **AI Integration**: Neurolink and Google AI services

### üèóÔ∏è **Repository Organization** (`src/shelly/cli.js`)
- **Purpose**: Project scaffolding, GitHub integration, and file organization
- **Key Components**: `commands/organize.js`, template system, GitHub integration
- **Features**: `shelly organize`, `shelly status`, `shelly init`

### üß† **Memory Bank** (`src/shelly/commands/memory.js`)
- **Purpose**: AI context management and documentation generation
- **Key Services**: `memoryBankService.js`, `aiContentGenerator.js`
- **Features**: `shelly memory init`, `shelly memory update`, persistent context

### Component Flow

## Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juspay/shelly
   cd shelly
   ```

   Note: The `git clone` command will create a folder named `shelly` by default. If you want a different folder name, you can specify it:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/juspay/shelly my-shelly-project
   cd my-shelly-project
   ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Test the CLI locally:**
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

## Making Changes

## Release Process

This project uses semantic-release for automated releases. When your PR is merged to the main branch:

1. Semantic-release analyzes commit messages
2. Determines the next version number
3. Generates release notes
4. Publishes to npm
5. Creates a GitHub release

## Getting Help

If you need help or have questions:

- Create a new issue with the "question" label
- Reach out to the maintainers

## Recognition

Contributors will be recognized in the project's README and release notes. Thank you for helping make Shelly better!
