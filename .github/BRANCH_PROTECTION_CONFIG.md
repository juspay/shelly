- ❌ **Require linear history** (optional)

## Feature Branch Protection

For feature branches (`feature/*`, `fix/*`):

### Recommended Settings
- ✅ **Require status checks to pass**
- ❌ **Require approvals** (optional for feature branches)
- ❌ **Require signed commits** (optional)

## Implementation

### Via GitHub UI

1. Go to **Settings** → **Branches**
2. Click **Add rule**
3. Set branch name pattern (e.g., `main`, `master`)
4. Configure protection settings as outlined above
5. Save the rule

### Via GitHub CLI

```bash
# Enable branch protection for main branch
gh api repos/juspay-maintainers/shelly/branches/main/protection \
  --method PUT \
  --field required_status_checks='{"strict":true,"contexts":["CI / test","CI / lint","CI / build"]}' \
  --field enforce_admins=true \
  --field required_pull_request_reviews='{"required_approving_review_count":2,"dismiss_stale_reviews":true,"require_code_owner_reviews":true}' \
  --field restrictions=null
```

### Via Terraform

```hcl
resource "github_branch_protection" "main" {
  repository_id = "shelly"
  pattern       = "main"

  required_status_checks {
    strict = true
    contexts = [
      "CI / test",
      "CI / lint", 
      "CI / build"
    ]
  }

  required_pull_request_reviews {
    required_approving_review_count = 2
    dismiss_stale_reviews          = true
    require_code_owner_reviews     = true
  }

  enforce_admins = true
}
```

## Monitoring

### Regular Reviews

- **Monthly**: Review branch protection settings
- **Quarterly**: Audit bypass attempts and failures
- **After incidents**: Review and update rules if needed

### Metrics to Track

- Number of protection rule violations
- Average time to merge PRs
- Code review coverage
- Failed status checks

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Status checks not appearing**
- Ensure CI workflows are properly configured
- Check that status check names match exactly

**Unable to merge despite approvals**
- Verify all required status checks are passing
- Check if branch is up to date with base branch

**Administrators cannot bypass**
- This is by design when "Include administrators" is enabled
- Temporarily disable protection to make emergency changes
